I'll assume you do have SDL installed, on your system.
If not, go to: www.libsdl.org , and get it.
To compile on Linux (and other Unix clones), you have to:
Edit the file global.h , and comment the  #define WINDOWS line.
Then, use this, in the source directory:
gcc -o terrained -g *.c -lSDL -lpthread

Please note that, in order for the program to work, you need the following files 
where the binary program is: font.bmp, icon.bmp, cursors.bmp and toolbar.bmp

I don't have a Linux machine, so I didn't test it on this OS, but some other people did,
and they reported me to work properly. In case you find a bug, please contact me.

Thanks to  Morpius <morpius@ntlworld.com> and  Bussman Alexander <zorax@linux.nu> 
for helping me with the porting stuff.
