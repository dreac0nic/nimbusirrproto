<table>
<tr><td>
<img src="place.jpg" border=0>
</td>
<td>
<b>Draw</b> a pixel, or a free hand line, with the current height.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="escavate.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Escavate</b> the terrain (new height=terrain height-current height).
In case the new height is smaller than 0, then new height = 0
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="elevate.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Elevate</b> the terrain (new height=terrain height+selected height).
In case the new height is bigger than 255, then new height = 255
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="peek.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Peek</b> the terrain height (like the eyedrop, in graphic programs)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="select.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Select</b> an area. Left click, after an area is selected will deselect it.<br>
<b><font color=red>Important:</font></b> When an area is selected, the following tools will
operate ONLY in that area, not on the entire map: <b>Smooth</b>, <b>Rise</b>, <b>Sink</b>, <b>Save</b>
and <b>New terrain</b>. <b>New terrain</b>, however, will act different: It will set the entire selected area
to the current height
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="replace.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Replace</b> the terrain height pointed by the mouse, with some other heights (see bellow).
<b>Right click</b> on that icon, and it will bring up the tolerance mode/value.
Basically, + tolerance means: "replace all the heights equal or greater than (the terrain height + tolerance value)
with the current height. - and +/- tolerance modes are similar. Replace mode means:<br>
<b>=</b> Just replace that height with the selected height.<br>
<b>-</b> Substract from the old height, the current height.<br>
<b>+</b> Add to the old height, the current height.<br>
The solid mode means "use the selected height", while pattern mode means using a selected pattern.<br>
It is hard to explain, really, just experiment and see for yourself :)

<tr><td>
<img src="global_replace.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Global Replace</b> is very similar with the <b>Replace</b> tool, only that it will affect the
ENTIRE terrain, instead of only the neighbour heigts that match the tollerance limit.
<b>Right click</b> on that icon, and it will bring up the tolerance mode/value.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="flood.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Flood</b> an area with the current height, until it finds the terrain height again.
Basically, if you draw a circle/rectangle, with the height of 10, and then you flood it's interior, with
height 10, it will fill that rectangle with height 10. However, if you try to fill it with height 11, it
will most likely ruin your entire terrain, trying to flood all the map. Just experiment with it.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="zoomin.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Zoom in</b> the terrain. There are 16 levels of zoom (100%-1600%). Note that you have to click
on an area you want to zoom. <b>Right click</b> on it and it will <b>zoom out</b>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="object.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Place object</b> on/in/over the terrain.<br>
<b>Right click</b> on it to get the options menu. Basically, there are 3 modes: Place, increase and decrease<br>
Place means it will just put that object OVER the existing heights.<br>
Increase means that the existing terrain will be increased with the height of the coresponding heights from that object.<br>
Decrease means the same as increase, only that the terrain will be decreased.<br>
I am not good at explaining things, so just play with the options, and you will see what they do.<br>
When you are using an object (dragging it with the mouse), if you right click the mouse, the object will
dissapear, and the current tool will be the pen (put height). So, next time you want to use the ojbect
tool, you will have to load another object.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="smooth.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Smooth</b> the entire terrain (averaging the heights). The more you use it, the flatter the terrain becomes.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="rise.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Rise</b> the entire terrain with the current height.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="sink.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Sink</b> the entire terrain with the current height.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="rotate.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Rotate</b> or flip the terrain.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="new.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>New</b> terrain. Choose a x/y size bigger than 63 pixels, and smaller than 10000 pixels, and a
background height, from 0 to 255. Note: It won't prompt you for a confirmation, so, unless you saved the previous terrain, that is lost.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="generate.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Generate</b> the relief. Note that, unless you check the option: "Overwrite terrain", it will only
generate a new terrain on the black (0) heights, leaving the others unaffected.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="load.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Load</b> a <a href="hmp_format.htm"><font color=black><b>hmp</b></font></a> or <b>bmp</b> file. Warning: there is no confirmation, so you will loose the old terrain, unless you saved it.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="save.jpg" border=0>
</td><td>
<b>Save</b> the current terrain into a <a href="hmp_format.htm"><font color=black><b>hmp</b></font></a> or <b>bmp</b> file.
</td></tr>
